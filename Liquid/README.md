# Liquid cooling via microchannel Test Cases (Section IV-C)
![](/image/chipstack.PNG)
This folder contains all the necessary files to run simulations described in the Section IV-C of our paper [1].

Users can manipulate the power number in ptrace_files/liquid_ptrace.csv. 

Users can also change the liquid flow velocity in /modelParams_files/modelParams_liquid.config

To run liquid cooling simulations, go to scripts and run the following commands:
```python
python liquid.py
```
