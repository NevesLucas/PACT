Overview
--------

This folder contains the required scripts to obtain the power map of a design using its RTL files. The folder contains the following files:  
  
1- Openstaparser.py : this script takes as input the DEF and the library files, and returns the power consumption and the coordinates of each standard gate in the design using Resizer.  
2- gridmesh.py : this script takes as input the DEF file, the output file generated by Openstaparser.py and the grid size. The script returns the power consumption and the coordinates of each block in the grid.  
3- Script_template : this file is used by the Openstaparser.py while calling resizer.  

Prerequisites
-------------

The following tools and files are required to run the flow, use the provided links to setup the tools:
  
1- Openroad flow for "Synthesis, Placement and routing" to convert the RTL files to a DEF file. Use the following link to setup the tool: [OpenRoad Flow.](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow/tree/master/flow)    
2- Resizer is used for power estimation. Use the following link to setup the tool: [Resizer.](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project-Attic/Resizer)    
3- The library files : lib and lef files.  


Launching the flow
------------------

After installing the previously mentioned tools and generating the DEF file, the following steps are required to generate the power map:  
  
1- Add the path to the lib, lef and def files in lines 1,2 and 3 of the Script_template file.  
2- Add the path to the DEF file in line 3 of the Openparser.py file.  
3- Add the path to the Resizer binary file in line 48 of the Openparser.py file.  
4- Add the path to the DEF file in line 1 of the gridmesh.py file.  
5- Add the desired gridsize in line 2 of the gridmesh.py file.  
6- Using python 3 run Openparser.py.  
7- In the same folder and using python 3 run gridmesh.py.  

The flow generates two files:  
1- flp : contains the dimensions and the coordinates of each block in the grid.  
2- ptrace : contains the power values of each block in the grid.
